# The Score-Driven Kinetic Ising Model

This Python 3 library implements simulation and estimation methods for the Score-Driven Kinetic Ising Model, as presented in the preprint by Campajola et al. (2020) https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15545.pdf

Requisites:
- Python 3
- pytorch
- numpy
- scipy.optimize and scipy.integrate

The src/ folder contains the source code for the SDKIM model class, while the examples/ folder contains example codes for simulation and estimation.
